1|by the way they've given you all of the background they tell you what the character looks like some writers even want to tell you what this character sounds like and they have all these little directions in script out maybe idiosyncrasies
2|and I care how much you promote a film if you don't have word of mouth you ain't promoting it
3|stay in business whatever that takes so they don't get on a social high horse and go you know running through the bushes we make movies to make money to make movies
4|that's hard to say because of the treatment has ch I'm not sure that treatment uh of me has changed so much as I have changed and my attitude
5|then I got on stage again uh four years later when I was twelve brilliant again so by the time I was thirteen it was pretty much a foregone conclusion in everybody elses mind teachers parents that acting was gonna be my thing
6|my first on-screen kiss was in the picture called street smart
7|I uh interviewed for Milos Forman for ragtime cause I read the book when I read the book cold house walker that's me I got that going away I have just gotten all kinds of accolades for Broadway play that I'd done I was the talk of the town surely you heard of me haven't you
8|yeah I better own number but you know anytime it about asked me that question Meryl Streep just bursts out of me
9|so no no preparation and the other part of that whole story is that I'm not what they call a method actor I just read script and stumble through a teacher once said uh who was what was his name Herbert Bergoff he said I fall in the category of intuitive I just into it and do it
10|I don't think there's an issue of race in Hollywood somewhere back there in the seventies the decision was made by almost all in sundry then we have to uh start open casting
11|movie acting is my favourite uh you know I did a lot of TV twenty years on stage and it was fun but it's just didn't hit that button you know
12|Sydney was a black actor at a time when there was only one doing what he was doing
13|but because nobody can say Shawshank Redemption it didn't get word of mouth and I don't care how much you promote a film if you don't have word-of-mouth you ain't promoting it
14|I hadn't like made a conscious decision I'm going to be an actor I don't think you do I think you just that's what you do
15|I was picked a day that I was going to go to the taxi and limousine commission to try and get my licence and the day before I decided to go I got a call from my agent Paul Newman is casting master seal
16|if you weren't an actor if you didn't make it as an actor what would you do I have no idea I would act somewhere maybe I'll be driving a cab maybe I'm working somebody's yard whatever I'm doing I'm going to belong to somebody's little theatre group
17|I'd say the last TV movie because in nineteen eighty one the phone didn't ring and in nineteen eighty two the phone didn't ring and so I decided along about some of nineteen eighty two that ok so you're fifteen minutes are up
18|People always say well uh we have still photographers on on set every set had still photographers and they say well if I'm in your eyeline I went just shut up I don't have an eyeline
19|Terrific as an actress, that yeah but there were um a whole just a whole list of people that I, I'd love ta, to work with that I hadn't had a shot at
20|no uh I had done a living person once before a movie called Lean On Me I played a teacher a school principal named Jo Clark and we shot at the school that he was the principal of and he was there every day very incredible man
21|I went to the movies all the time I pretty much lived in the movies whenever I had spare time or thirteen cents and that period we were refighting World War two you know so I decided by age fifteen that I wanted to be a jet pilot cause I got in a lot of trouble at school
22|what would you do if you weren't an actor if you didn't make it as an actor what would you do I have no idea I would act somewhere maybe I'll be driving a cab maybe I'm working somebody's yard whatever I'm doing I'm going to belong to somebody's little theatre group
23|so we did over years meet him in different places we met in Monico we met in Washington we met in New York we even met in Memphis Tennessee and each time I was called to his side and I sat with him and uh walked with him talked with him but always watching and listening
24|you spend twenty years waiting tables at night if you're a writer you're writing and it's the same thing with any discipline, painters paint. I don't care what else they have to do to put food on the table to pay the rent they paint and I think that's the same way all the around
25|discipline and humility, mostly discipline. Stage calls for a lot more discipline than movies. You gotta learn an entire play and then you got to say every word every night Lord help you if you get if you forget have I ever forgotten, yep. That's why I say Lord help you
26|in fact the first scientists who proposed the big bang Georges Leemet was a priest and a member of the pontifical academy of Science
27|here in the Tunnel who low there were here obviously all kinds of rituals, particularly burial rituals. But no sign of an organised religion so the question remains unanswered for me did religion allow man to live together, grow food or did civilization give rise to our belief in God
28|go back le taffee traces the birth of religious worship back more than eleven thousand years. Long before there were Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhist, people came together to talk, eat, worship. It could be that the Driving Force behind our greatest achievement, civilization, was god
29|so we have the two different approaches to the idea of creation, Genesis and then theres the big bang
30|you can't understand me without understanding where I was created. Every religion has a creation story, so, what did those stories tell us about who we are and where we came from
31|now I never had any doubts about where I was supposed I had doubts about whether or not I would get there
32|what, what I really like about this scene, and I love this scene, is that the empowerment of that character has little to do with that character everything to do with Kathy Baker
33|I'm adjusting to that right now where I am I don't really know I think I'm on the cusp of the feeling of retirement, now I'm not gonna retire no I'm I'm not gonna retire, but you get to a point where you say you know I'm, I could pull back you know I could, I could uh get more space between me and work
34|Let me tell you a little anecdote about Alfred give you an idea here. uh Driving Miss Daisy opened off broadway the first incarnation I've had the playwright Horizons in this within the same period week or so had the street smart open in the movies so one day Alfred went to a matinee
35|I had the great Good Fortune I should say in Ireland to work with Jeremy Brett
36|Yes was I was going to go to Paris in nineteen sixty three I was on my way to Paris and I got as far as New York
37|it's the same thing with Alex Cross he's he's has that sense to me of the detective who sits and ponders who who comes to conclusions by the weight of of visible evidence
38|well as soon as I got on a New York stage now I began to yeah track upwards I think is a good term to use. Um I had my first I got a job as a bus and truck tour of the royal under the sun nineteen sixty six
39|up to that time I've been very deep in dance because when I was in school in Los Angeles part of the curriculum of the theatre department was dance movements and I start going to those classes and the instructor was a lady and she said Oh my goodness you, you really have a flair for this you should follow it you should do more because you know actors who sing and dance have much more chance of work then those who are just acting
40|I am saying the character who drives the entire story that naration was beautifully written
41|Probably the most fortunate part of all of Our Lives those of us who have this Good Fortune is figuring out what that is being guided in that direction
42|that this time they would let them out, but there was speeches before this when he tells you how difficult getting up would be if you manage to because you do come to depend on the walls of the institution, he's talking in a sense about institutionalisation. Now when he comes up for parole where's he going to go, what's he going to do. He has no skills he has no no friends there's nothing out there for him anyway so listen it doesn't matter anymore
43|what I really like about this scene and I love this scene is that the empowerment of that character has little to do with that character and everything to do with Kathy Baker
44|cause ninety nine point nine percent of the time when um when uh a Broadway play Goes To Hollywood because with Hollywood people Zach it does not go with New Yorkers there is reason for that I'm sure by and large um actors on stage are stage actors which is a bit too broad for the movie actors its going to take some adjustment
45|and right out of that into hello darling right out of hello darling into a little off-broadway revue called the DMZ fellow here in New York his name is Izaiah Chefromay who runs this um the symphony space which is a theatre Upper West Side at the time he was just producing and writing along with the Great i don't know if he is still with us
46|I'm looking for the correct term it isn't guilt its remorse remorse did you ever experience that that you know of
47|well let me ask you how did you get to the street why were you on the street
48|I have recently spent some time with a person who we could say it personifies
49|evil is not spurned evil is thought of as a spirit that needs help just needs to find peace
50|and there is no saying there is no devil something outside influencing us meaning therefore that God is resident in each of us
51,things around us aren't always what they seem
52,In the everyday world we use a simple scale, ourselves, to know what's small and what's large
55,In the meantime, people around the world gazed on the stars and gave them names
56,two thousand years past before a revolutionary breakthrough was made by a mathematics professor of the ancient maritime republic of Venice
58,From the tallest bell towers he showed that this device could spot approaching ships hours before their sails were visible to the naked eye
59,later when he aimed his telescope at the night sky Galileo discovered that the moon was a whirl with mountains, Jupiter had its own moons and the Milky Way was a band of countless stars
61,Over 3 centuries ago, Anton Van Leeuwenhoek perfected the early microscope and used it to study droplets from the waterways of Holland
64,Designed to create conditions like those that existed just after the birth of our universe
65,Now our cosmic voyage enters another dimension
66,The dimension of time, where knowledge is much less certain
67,studying traces of quartz from these collisions, physicists are trying to learn what our universe was like when it began after the explosion known as the big bang
69,Some, called blue green bacteria slowly released tiny bubbles of oxygen
74,and I felt this fear for the first time ever
75,how can I bring a child into a world like this, how can, how can a person grow up with all this around them
76,but if you choose to have this baby
77,today I'm feeling presidential
78,I really thought of keeping you on just to fuck with you over the next 3 and a half years
79,let me get this straight
80,you think that you're client, one of the wealthiest most powerful men in the world
81,is secretly a vigilante who spends his night beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands
82,and your plan is to blackmail this person
83,I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged
84,the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice but still the place you live in is that much more drab and empty now that they're gone
85,those few days were like one big roller coaster ride and like most rides we ended up where we began
86,still it reminded us who we are what we have it was worth it if only for that, maybe one day we'll sell
87,but for now we'll just deal with what is the important thing is it brought us back here together back to our senses
